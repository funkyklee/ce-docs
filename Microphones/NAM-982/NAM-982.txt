# In the Box

-   Microphone

-   Antenna adapter

-   Wireless receiver

-   Cable (1/4" to XLR)

-   1/4" to 1/8" adapter

# How to Connect

To start using your microphone, connect it to the input of a speaker
system or amplifier.

Your microphone can be connected to systems with:

-   1/4" input

-   1/8" input (with the included adapter)

## Wired Connection

1.  Connect the XLR end of the cable to the bottom of the microphone.

2.  Connect the 1/4" end of the cable to a speaker system input (or use
    the included 1/8" plug adapter).

3.  Set the switch on the microphone to the "MIC" position.

## Wireless Connection

1.  Load one "AA" battery into the battery compartment found on the back
    of the wireless receiver.

<!-- 
    Make sure to match the polarity marked inside the battery compartment.
-->

2.  Turn the wireless receiver on and extend its antenna.

3.  Connect the 1/4" plug of the wireless receiver to a speaker system
    input (or use the included 1/8" plug adapter).

4.  Twist and unscrew the bottom half of the microphone clockwise to
    reveal the battery compartment. Load one "AA" battery into the
    microphone, then screw the bottom back on.

<!-- 
    Disconnect the cable from the microphone before opening the microphone. Failure to do so will damage the microphone.

    Make sure to match the polarity marked inside the battery compartment.
-->
5.  Connect the antenna adapter to the bottom of the microphone. (Align
    the arrow on the antenna with the switch on the microphone.)

6.  Set the switch on the microphone to the ON position.

# Placing Your Microphone

The optimal position for your microphone relative to the sound source
depends on a few factors, but it is mostly a matter of trial and error.
Experiment with different distances and positions to see which sounds
best, but keep the following things in mind.

## Cardioid

-   Cardioid microphones are more sensitive to sounds that are in front
    of it. Sounds from behind the microphone will be slightly muted.
    Cardioid microphones are great for vocal or speech recording.

-   When using a microphone for vocal or speech work, the closer you are
    to the microphone the more likely it will pick up "plosives" when
    recording. Consider placing a pop filter between the speaker and the
    microphone.
