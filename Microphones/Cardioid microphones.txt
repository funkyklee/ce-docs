## Cardioid

-   Cardioid microphones are more sensitive to sounds that are in front
    of it. Sounds from behind the microphone will be slightly muted.
    Cardioid microphones are great for vocal or speech recording.

-   When using a microphone for vocal or speech work, the closer you are
    to the microphone the more likely it will pick up "plosives" when
    recording. Consider placing a pop filter between the speaker and the
    microphone.
