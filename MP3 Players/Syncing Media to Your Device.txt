Syncing Media to Your Player
To start enjoying media on your player, you will need to transfer the media files from a computer to your player.  

There are many ways to get your favorite media in a digital format. The most convenient way is to purchase and download them from the Internet onto your computer. From your computer, you can sync these media files to your device for playback.

Info: A few popular stores that sell digital music are Amazon http://www.amazon.com/MP3) and Google Play (http://play.google.com/store/music). Some stores may also offer free downloads of singles from up-and-coming artists!
A few stores may offer downloads in different digital formats. MP3 is the most popular format and is guaranteed to work on all players. If you choose an alternate format, please review the specifications of your device to make sure that your device supports it.

Now that you have media files on your computer, you will need to sync them to your player. You can either use your computer's standard file browser to manually copy the files to your player, or use a software program to organize and sync the files to your player. These media manager programs are included with most modern computers.
