Power For Your Device

[RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES]
Your device contains a rechargeable lithium ion battery. Give it a full charge before using your device for the first time. This can help your battery's performance and lifespan.

Use the included USB cable to charge your device from any USB port on a computer. You may also use the included cable to charge your device with a USB power adapter (optional). When using a power adapter, make sure that its rated output matches your device. (Please refer to the Specifications section for your device's Power rating.)

Tips: All rechargeable batteries have a fixed amount of charge/discharge cycles. Observe the following to ensure the best performance from your battery.
- Charge batteries at normal room temperature. Charging a battery at high or very low temperatures will shorten its lifespan.
- Avoid using or storing your device in high temperatures.
- Avoid leaving your device plugged in. Continually charging a battery when it is full will shorten its lifespan.
- Avoid discharging the battery completely.
- All rechargeable batteries will discharge slowly over time even not in use. If your device will be inactive for a long time, consider charging it periodically.

[ALKALINE BATTERIES]
Your device requires [#] [SIZE] batteries. Take care to match the polarity markings in the battery compartment when you are installing batteries. If the device has a battery level indicator, replace the batteries as directed. Otherwise, replace the batteries when you notice the device's performance worsening.

Tips:
- Replace all batteries at once. Do not mix old and new batteries.
- Use the same type of batteries. Do not mix batteries with different voltages or different chemistry types (e.g., alkaline, nickel-metal hydride, lithium).
- For rechargeable batteries, use batteries that are fully charged. Do not mix partially charged batteries.
- Never charge batteries that are not meant to be charged.
