Using the Headphones without Bluetooth(r)
-----------------------------------------

Your headphones can be used without connecting to a wireless Bluetooth enabled
device. Simply use a 3.5mm audio patch cable (optional) to connect the headphone
jack of the device to the 3.5mm AUX input jack of the headphones.

Tip: Turn off the power when using the headphones without a Bluetooth
connection. The remote control, volume, and other functions will not work
without a Bluetooth connection.
