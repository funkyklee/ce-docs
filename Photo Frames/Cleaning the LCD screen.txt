# Cleaning the Screen

- Turn the unit off and disconnect it from all power sources before
cleaning it.

- The screen is an optical instrument and can be permanently scratched
or damaged if it is not treated carefully. Avoid touching the screen or
allowing any objects to come in contact with it.

- If fingerprints or dust accumulate on the screen, gently wipe them
away with a camera lens cloth or similar soft microfiber cloth. Make
sure that the cloth is clean and lint-free before using it to clean the
screen.

- If necessary, lightly moisten the camera lens cloth with water before
cleaning the screen. **Do not use any other liquid or aerosol cleaners.
